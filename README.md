# binary-search
<span><h3>Recursive and iterative implementation of the binary search algorithm</h3><hr /></span>

To test my code,
- clone this repo on your machine
- create a new file(ex: <em>sample.py</em>) and inside it import the <em>main.py</em> :
  <em>from main import *</em>
- use any version you want, the recursive one or the iterative one by calling the functions

<span><h2>This version is only for students who wants a simpler implementation of the binary search algorithm, not for experts!</span>
