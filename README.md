# binary-search
<span><h3>Recursive and iterative implementation of the binary search algorithm</h3><hr /></span>

To test my code,
- clone this repo on your machine
- create a new file(ex: <em>sample.py</em>) and inside it import the <em>main</em>(which consists of all the python files in the current directory) :
  <em>from main import *</em>
- use any version you want, the recursive one(binsearch_recursive) or the iterative one(binsearch_iterative) by calling the functions

<strong>The code shall include comments(for the code to be easier to understand) in the near future</strong>
<span><h2>This version is only for students who wants a simpler implementation of the binary search algorithm, not for experts!</span>
